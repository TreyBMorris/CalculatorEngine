## Why? 
After completing my project for the semester, I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can replicate the project again but doing it my own way. To start, the challenge was to rewrite the backend code for the project. .NET has always been something I have wanted to grow my abilities in, so for this the backend is being developed in .NET. The buisiness logic, unit tests, and RESTful API are hosted on this repository. The goal is to deploy the backend as a full API, and rewrite the frontend interface in different frameworks. Notably, one front end will be written in Angular using TypeScript. Afterwards, the goal will be to use other frontend frameworks or plain JavaScript to develop the frontend. This way, I am learning about both the frontend and backend side of a project so that I can pursue my interest in being a full-stack developer.
